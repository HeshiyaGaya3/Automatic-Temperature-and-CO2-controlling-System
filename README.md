# Automatic-Temperature-and-CO2-controlling-System
This project presents the design and implementation of an automated system for temperature control and CO2 indication utilizing NodeMCU and Blynk integration. The system addresses the need for efficient environmental monitoring and control in various settings such as smart homes, greenhouses, and industrial facilities.
The system operates by continuously monitoring the ambient actions to maintain optimal conditions. For instance, if the temperature exceeds the desired range, the system activates cooling or heating mechanisms to restore equilibrium. Similarly, if CO2 levels rise the buzzer starts to activate and notify the user on their mobile device also. Upon detecting deviations from predefined thresholds, the NodeMCU triggers appropriate ve acceptable limits, ventilation systems are engaged to facilitate air exchange.
